		<p>You are in a candy world, sumptuously munching your way through its paths or perhaps you find yourself locked in a haunted house hoping you could find your way out! From the wildest, exhilarating and magical dreams down to the most realistic ones, everyone has experienced the magic of dreams.<br>On a scientific note, when you sleep, our brain is active and you undergo two states: the Rapid Eye Movement <strong>(REM)</strong> and the Non Rapid Eye Movement <strong>(NREM)</strong>. Roughly 80% of your sleeping period is your indulgence to the state of NREM where your heart rate and breathing slows down and regularizes(Moss, 2007). Furthermore, accroding to the study conducted by the Aalto University(2016, August 9), even if dreaming is known to transpire mostly in REM sleep, recent and present researches show that sleep can also possibly occur during the NREM state and could denote a closer brain activity in comparison to awake people.</p>

		<h1>Stages of NREM</h1>
			<h2><strong>STAGE 1</strong></h2>
			<p>	<strong>Stage 1</strong> is light sleep where you drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily by a sensation of falling.</p>
		
			<h2><strong>STAGE 2</strong></h2>
			<p>	In <strong>stage 2</strong>, the body begins to prepare for deep sleep.</p>
		
			<h2><strong>STAGE 3</strong></h2>
			<p>	When a person enters <strong>stage 3</strong>, he/she experiences deep sleep. During this stage that a person may experience night terrors and bedwetting.</p>

			<h2><strong>STAGE 4</strong></h2>
			<p >In <strong>stage 4</strong>, deep sleep continues. People roused from this state feel disoriented for a few minutes.</p>

		<h1>REM SLEEP</h1>
			<p><strong>Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep, REMS)</strong> is a unique phase of sleep in mammals and birds, distinguishable by random/rapid movement of the eyes, accompanied with low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly.<br>During <strong>REM (rapid eye movement) sleep</strong>, brain waves mimic activity during the waking state. The eyes remain closed but move rapidly from side-to-side, perhaps related to the intense dream and brain activity that occurs during this stage.</p>

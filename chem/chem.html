		<p>The study of dreams, also known as <strong>oneirology</strong> is one amazing topic to learn. Dreams are visualization of certain imagery and/or sensations that happen when the body is in deep sleep. Dreams happen due to various chemicals that are all located in the brain which projects those ideas, emotions, images, and/or sensations when the body is asleep. These various chemicals have been tested by various scientists to see and prove things suh as how not only humans have dreams, but other living things such as birds and mammals too. Studies show that a person averages four to seven dreams a night that go as to much as 20 minutes and as less as a few seconds in duration which means that 20% of the sleep we get mainly contain dreams.</p>

		<h1>chemicals in dreams</h1>
			<h2><strong>melatonin</strong></h2>
			<p>One of the chemicals that the brain uses is Melatonin also known as “the hormone of the night”. It is a hormone made in the body by the pineal gland which is located above the middle of the brain. According to research, melatonin levels are at its peak in the blood for 12 hours at night while it goes back to daytime levels, which is barely detectable, when the clock hits 9 am. It is also used as a sleeping aid in various countries which help workers that are adjusting to a new schedule. This hormone is also responsible for the prolonged amount of REM dreaming stages one is in which makes it so that the dreamer can be able to easily remember their dreams. It has a recommended dose of 3-5 milligrams however, taking high doses of Melatonin may cause the person to have more lucid dreams or nightmares. According to Mayo Clinic’s experts, taking Melatonin supplements mostly lead to daytime sleepiness, dizziness and headaches. Other side effects may include abdominal discomfort, mild anxiety, irritability, confusion, and short-lasting feels of depression.</p>
		
			<h2><strong>oxytocin</strong></h2>
			<p>Oxytocin, also known as the hormone of love. Is also one of the chemicals that is used in the brain to handle our dreams. This hormone is in charge for the social connections that sometimes present themselves in  dreams. This hormone causes the feelings that people have in reality during the REM process, which also applies in their dreams. </p>
		
			<h2><strong>adenosine</strong></h2>
			<p>A molecule known as Adenosine flows through the blood stream when the person is awake but eventually makes the person sleepy and tired. Levels of this particular hormone play a big role in non-REM sleep. Adenosine Deaminase, an enzyme in the body, breaks down Adenosine molecules which causes the person to fall asleep. Adenosine continue to drop throughout the duration of the sleep.</p>

			<h2><strong>Acetylcholine</strong></h2>
			<p >One other circumstance that brings the stages of dreaming is the abundance of Acetylcholine in the brain, which is one of the brain’s main neurotransmitters. While the brain cells that use this are active, other cells that use different neurotransmitters are subdued. It has been observed in research that the dreaming state can be brought upon abruptly in animals when a substance acts like acetylcholine is injected directly into certain nerve cells of the pons. It  is belived that all dreaming  activities happen during REM sleep.Various studies about this has been conducted under the leadership of Dr. Honson and Dr. McCarley which showed that drugs that are similar to acetylcholine may be able to produce REM sleep. The experiments also show that other treatment that interfered with the natural beakdown of the nerve signal substance would cause the same affect. </p>

		<h1>rem potion</h1>
			<p>One study in particular stands out. A study conducted by Dr. Helen A. Baghdoyan, which resides at Pennsylvania State University in Hershey, on cats had dramatic response. REM sleep began within two to three minutes after injecting the drug, instead of it being a half hour naturally. The sleep lasted for about two to four hours instead of six minutes.<br>Another experiment was conducted at the University of California by Dr. J. Christian Gillin’s group. The experiment was conducted among sleep volunteers, they were given drugs that act like acetycholine in the brain. Related studies have said that drug-induced REM sleep produce similar dreams that occur in natural sleep.<br>A theory on REM sleep proposed 10 years ago by Dr. McCarley and Dr. Hobson, states that this combination of signalling within the brain without resultant physical movements is actually the raw material of dreams having so that the sleeping brain forms images and scenarios that is trying to make sense of its own internal signalling. But they state that they do not suggest that dreams’ content is random. They state that an individual may have his /her own unique dream that is worthy of scrutinity.<br>Basing on all human experiences, it suggests that the nondreaming phases of sleep represent periods of rest but this does not agree with REM sleep which states that the brain is fully active all throughout. Meaning that the stages of rest is when the person is in really deep sleep. This is when no signal is responding because the brain hardly responds to anything from the outside world. But the dreamer’s dream waves are more those of light sleep. The eyes remain active, darting back and forth and portions of the brain seem to be intensely active.<br>The rate of metabolism depends on the intensity and duration of sleep. Slow brain waves are present during sleep. Metabolism reduces adenosine levels. These levels reduce as sleep continues. </p>
